    "# Loading a sample Database\n",
    "To practice our SQL-fu, we'll be using a sample database named `dvdrental` downloaded from [here](https://www.postgresqltutorial.com/postgresql-getting-started/postgresql-sample-database/). This database can be found online in several places, usually as a [zip file](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZIP_(file_format)) which we have to extract. The result is a [tar file](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tar_(computing)) that we'll be loading into our database using [pg_restore](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/app-pgrestore.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "> You should find the `dvdrental.tar` file in the repository files.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Create a Database\n",
    "First thing we have to do is to create a database named `dvdrental`:\n",
    "```\n",
    "createdb -h localhost -p 5432 -U bob dvdrental\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "> You'll be **interactively** prompted for a password, so run the command above in a **terminal**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Restore data\n",
    "Once the database has been created, we can **restore** the data from the `dvdrental.tar` file. We'll be using the `pg_restore` command, with several options:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `-c` (short for `--clean`) is for dropping database objects before recreating them.\n",
    "- `-d` (short for `--dbname`) is for restoring the data directly into the database used as argument (the `dvdrental` we created before).\n",
    "- `--no-owner`, because I was getting an error related to the user `postgres` (maybe the data dump was created with this user).\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "pg_restore -h localhost -U bob --no-owner -c -d dvdrental ./dvdrental.tar\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "> The command above will also run interactively, so that we can enter the **password** of `bob`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Connecting to the New Database\n",
    "Now let's create a connection to the `dvdrental` database:"
